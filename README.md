# Background
This project came about because some of my colleagues were talking about the role playing game D&D and were mentioning how neat it would be to make a full video game based off the table top. since I am fairly new to making video games I thought about making a combat based game demo based off of fantasy monsters.

# Technologies
1. MakeHuman (Version 1.1.1)
Website: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/
There were a couple of softwares that were used for this project. One of the first Softwares used was MakeHuman. MakeHuman is a free open-source program designed for giving users an easy way of creating 3D humanoids. Also has a large repository of 3D assets for your created model. This program was used to make the player character by selecting the zombie humanoid model then adding warlock robes and a medieval helmet.
