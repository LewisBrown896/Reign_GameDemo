# Background
This project came about because some of my colleagues were talking about the role playing game D&D and were mentioning how neat it would be to make a full video game based off the table top. since I am fairly new to making video games I thought about making a combat based 1v1 fighting game demo based off of fantasy monsters as my first game.

# Technologies
1. MakeHuman (Version 1.1.1)  
Website: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/  
There were a couple of softwares that were used for this project. One of the first Softwares used was MakeHuman. MakeHuman is a free open-source program designed for giving users an easy way of creating 3D humanoids. Also has a large repository of 3D assets for your created model. This program was used to make the player character by selecting the zombie humanoid model then adding warlock robes and a medieval helmet.

2. Blender (Version 2.82)  
Website: https://www.blender.org/  
Blender is another open source software, but blender is for all types of 3D modeling and can even do animations. This software was used for the game demo to make 3D models of swords and shields.

4. Unity (Version 2018.4.8f1)  
Website: https://unity.com/  
The Unity game engine is capable of rendering full 3D environments, handling complex animations, and uses C# as a programming language. Unity is chosen for this project because it uses the programming language C# which is what i am most familiar with. Unity will be responsible for handeling all the scripts, animations, 3D characters, and 3D environments.

3. Visual Studio 2019 (Version 16.2)  
Website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/  
Microsoft's IDE that is able to create scripts for the game written in c#. Visual Studio was chosen because it supports integration to Unity. This IDE will be used to create scripts for the enemy AI, animation cycles, game physics, and damage calculations  
  
4. Adobe mixamo
Website: https://www.mixamo.com/#/  
Adobe mixamo is a website that makes animation and rigging a lot easier. Mixamo has a large library of free 3d models and animations. You can even upload your own 3d model and it will place the skeleton inside that model. This website will be used in this project for is vast array of animations.
